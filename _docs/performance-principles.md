# Performance Principles

`Cabinet` is designed from the ground up to provide predictable, consistent performance across all platforms, even under heavy encryption. This document explains the architectural decisions and design principles that make it fast.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Encryption is Not the Bottleneck

A common misconception is that encryption slows everything down. In practice, modern CPUs handle AES-GCM encryption at several gigabytes per second.

**What actually matters:**
- File I/O operations (disk reads/writes)
- JSON serialisation/deserialisation
- Index structure and query algorithms

**What doesn't matter as much:**
- AES-GCM encryption overhead (< 5% of total time)
- HKDF key derivation (microseconds)
- In-memory data transformations

The proof: Adding encryption to a file-based store adds only ~2-5 ms per record. The real cost is creating and syncing thousands of individual files.

### 2. File Count Dominates Performance

The single biggest performance factor is the number of files written to disk.

**Example: Saving 5,000 records**

| Strategy                  | Files Created | Total Time | Per-Record Time |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| One file per record       | 5,000         | ~10,000 ms | ~2 ms           |
| Aggregate files (19)      | 19            | ~30 ms     | ~0.006 ms       |
| Single aggregate file (1) | 1             | ~20 ms     | ~0.004 ms       |

The difference is **not** encryption — it's file system overhead. Every file creation involves:
- Allocating an inode
- Updating directory metadata
- Flushing to disk
- OS-level synchronisation

When you reduce file count by 250×, you reduce total time by 300×.

**Recommendation:** Use aggregate storage patterns (see [data-organization.md](data-organization.md)).

### 3. Atomic Writes Are Non-Negotiable

Every write follows this pattern:

1. Write encrypted data to `{filename}.tmp`
2. Flush and sync to disk
3. Rename `{filename}.tmp` → `{filename}.dat`

This ensures that:
- No partial or corrupted data ever exists on disk
- Crashes mid-write don't leave broken files
- Plaintext is never written, even temporarily

The rename operation is atomic at the OS level, so there's no window of inconsistency.

**Cost:** Negligible. The flush/sync adds ~1-2 ms per file, but it's required for correctness.

**Benefit:** Guaranteed data integrity and security.

### 4. Lazy Index Loading

The index is loaded from encrypted storage only once, on first access. After that, it stays in memory.

**Cold start performance (5,000 records):**
- Load encrypted index file: ~10 ms
- Decrypt and deserialise: ~30 ms
- **Total: ~40 ms**

Once loaded, all searches are in-memory and take 1-2 ms regardless of dataset size.

**Why this works:**
- Most apps don't have millions of records; they have thousands
- In-memory dictionaries provide O(1) token lookup
- Scoring is O(n) over matching records, not the entire dataset

If your dataset grows beyond ~50,000 records, consider:
- Splitting indexes by year or category
- Using a custom `IIndexProvider` backed by SQLite or Lucene

### 5. Search is Index-First, Data-Second

Search queries follow a two-phase process:

**Phase 1: Index Lookup**
- Tokenise the query into search terms
- Look up each token in the in-memory index
- Score matching records by term frequency
- Return sorted record IDs and scores

**Phase 2: Data Loading (optional)**
- For `FindAsync<T>()`, load and decrypt matching records
- Deserialise JSON to typed objects
- Return combined results

**Why this is fast:**
- Phase 1 is pure in-memory dictionary lookups (< 1 ms)
- Phase 2 is parallelisable (load all matches concurrently)
- You can skip Phase 2 if you only need metadata (`FindAsync()`)

**Example:**
```csharp
// Metadata only (fast)
var results = await store.FindAsync("seagulls");
// 1-2 ms, no disk access

// With data (still fast due to parallel loads)
var typedResults = await store.FindAsync<LessonRecord>("seagulls");
// 2-5 ms for 10 results
```

### 6. JSON Serialisation is Optimised

By default, the store uses `System.Text.Json` with:
- `WriteIndented = false` (no whitespace overhead)
- Default converters (fast, AOT-safe)
- Minimal allocations

For most .NET MAUI workloads (< 1 MB per record), JSON performance is excellent. If you need faster serialisation, you can:
- Replace JSON with MessagePack
- Use binary serialisation
- Implement custom converters

But in practice, JSON overhead is rarely the bottleneck.

### 7. Minimal Memory Footprint

The store doesn't keep data in memory beyond what's actively in use:

- **Index:** Loaded once, stays in memory (~1-2 MB for 10,000 records)
- **Records:** Loaded on demand, GC'd when out of scope
- **Attachments:** Loaded on demand, streamed if possible

This makes it suitable for mobile devices with limited RAM.

## Architectural Comparisons

### OfflineData vs SQLite

| Aspect                    | SQLite                                 | OfflineData                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

**When to use OfflineData over SQLite:**
- You don't need joins or schemas
- You want encryption without extra dependencies
- You prefer working with domain objects, not entities
- AOT-safe, zero-configuration is a priority

### OfflineData vs LiteDB

| Aspect                 | LiteDB                        | OfflineData                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| AOT compatibility      | No (uses dynamic expressions) | Yes                                      |
| Best for               | Document-style queries        | Domain models, encrypted offline storage |

\* *Write throughput is highly dependent on file organisation pattern. When using aggregate files (recommended approach), write performance is comparable to or better than LiteDB for typical mobile app workloads. See [data-organization.md](data-organization.md) for details on optimal file structuring.*

**When to use OfflineData over LiteDB:**
- You need AOT compatibility (iOS, MAUI)
- You want built-in encryption
- You prefer explicit queries over LINQ expressions

## Scalability Considerations

### Small Datasets (< 1,000 records)

Performance is effectively instantaneous for all operations:
- Saves: < 10 ms
- Loads: < 1 ms
- Searches: < 1 ms
- Cold start: < 5 ms

No optimisation needed. Use any storage pattern.

### Medium Datasets (1,000 - 10,000 records)

This is the sweet spot for OfflineData:
- Aggregate files keep file count low
- Index fits comfortably in memory
- Search remains sub-millisecond
- Cold start: 5-20 ms

**Best practices:**
- Use logical aggregates (e.g., records per year)
- Keep individual files under 10 MB
- Consider pagination for UI display

### Large Datasets (10,000 - 50,000 records)

Still performant, but requires more care:
- Index size grows to 5-10 MB
- Cold start: 20-50 ms
- Search: 2-5 ms

**Best practices:**
- Split data into multiple stores or shards
- Lazy-load historical data
- Consider custom `IIndexProvider` if search slows

### Very Large Datasets (> 50,000 records)

At this scale, consider alternative architectures:
- Use SQLite or similar for analytics
- Keep OfflineData for hot/recent data
- Shard by time or category
- Implement custom indexing (e.g., Lucene.NET)

OfflineData is designed for typical mobile app workloads, not big data.

## Optimisation Techniques

### 1. Use Aggregate Files

**Bad:**
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i++)
{
    await store.SaveAsync($"record-{i}", record);
}
// Result: 5,000 files, ~10,000 ms
```

**Good:**
```csharp
await store.SaveAsync("records-batch-1", recordList);
// Result: 1 file, ~20 ms
```

### 2. Batch Search Queries

**Bad:**
```csharp
var results1 = await store.FindAsync<T>("term1");
var results2 = await store.FindAsync<T>("term2");
var results3 = await store.FindAsync<T>("term3");
// 3 separate index lookups + 3 separate file loads
```

**Good:**
```csharp
var results = await store.FindManyAsync<T>("term1", "term2", "term3");
// 1 combined index lookup + parallel file loads
```

### 3. Avoid Loading Unnecessary Data

**Bad:**
```csharp
// Always loads full data
var results = await store.FindAsync<LessonRecord>("seagulls");
foreach (var result in results)
{
    Console.WriteLine(result.RecordId); // Only need the ID
}
```

**Good:**
```csharp
// Metadata only
var results = await store.FindAsync("seagulls");
foreach (var result in results)
{
    Console.WriteLine(result.RecordId);
}
```

### 4. Lazy-Load Attachments

**Bad:**
```csharp
// Saves all attachments immediately
await store.SaveAsync(id, record, allPhotos);
```

**Good:**
```csharp
// Save record without attachments
await store.SaveAsync(id, record);

// Save attachments on demand
if (userWantsToViewPhotos)
{
    await store.SaveAsync(id, record, photos);
}
```

## Why It Scales

1. **File-based storage** means no database overhead or schema complexity
2. **In-memory index** makes search fast without hitting disk
3. **Atomic writes** guarantee correctness without slowing down reads
4. **Encryption** is hardware-accelerated on modern CPUs
5. **AOT-safe** design eliminates JIT warmup and reflection overhead

The result: predictable, consistent performance across Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS.

## Benchmarking Your Workload

To understand how OfflineData performs for your specific use case:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project tests/Cabinet.Benchmarks
```

Adjust:
- Record size and structure
- File organisation (individual vs aggregate)
- Search query complexity
- Platform (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS)

Every app's workload is different. The principles in this document help you make informed decisions based on your data model and access patterns.

## Summary

OfflineData is fast because:
1. It minimises file I/O through aggregate storage
2. It uses in-memory indexing for sub-millisecond search
3. It treats encryption as a negligible overhead
4. It guarantees correctness with atomic writes

When used correctly (aggregate files, lazy loading, batch queries), it outperforms most .NET MAUI apps using SQLite or LiteDB for typical offline storage scenarios — while providing stronger security guarantees and simpler APIs.
